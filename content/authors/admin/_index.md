I am a firt year PhD candidate at the University of Cyprus, as part of the Marie-Curie CLIPE project under the supervision of Professor [Yiorgos Chrysanthou](http://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~yiorgos/). I currently work on the [CLIPE](https://www.clipe-itn.eu/) project to design the next-generation of VR-ready characters, capable of behaving realistically while interacting with real users.
